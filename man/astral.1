.SH DESCRIPTION
.B astral
is the unified package manager for the Astaraxia Linux distribution.
It supports installing software either from prebuilt binary packages or
via source compilation using deterministic, declarative build recipes.

Astral maintains a local database of installed packages, resolves
dependencies, manages conflicts, and provides reproducible, transparent
build outputs.

All package definitions are stored as
.BR .astral
recipes that describe sources, build instructions, and file installation
rules.
